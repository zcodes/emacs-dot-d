* About

This is my new Emacs configure files. Until now, it only contains some
basic configrations and some common used plugins, and it won't intent
to be a full-stack configuration or a public published
configuration. I use Emacs and Org-mode for my notes and todos, maybe
it will be powerful in the future.

The plugins managed by [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get][El-Get]], and the plugins list below.
